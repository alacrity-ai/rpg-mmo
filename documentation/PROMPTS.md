# Battle Arena Prompts:

## Example:

```
You are an experienced pixel artist.

Make me a 32-bit pixel art style background for a JRPG battle scene. The scene should feature a dark, brooding forest with detailed pixelated trees and eerie foliage. The ground should be a grassy field with intricate pixel art details, and the overall atmosphere should be ominous and mysterious. There should be no characters, enemies, or actors, just the background and environment to create a perfect setting for a battle scene. The aspect ratio should be 16:9 to fit standard screen dimensions.
```

```
You are an experienced pixel artist.

Make me a 32-bit pixel art style background for a JRPG battle scene.

The scene should feature a dark style with the following description: Daytime field, some grass, sparse trees, with a grey cloudy forebiding sky.

There should be no characters, no enemies, no actors, no interface. There should only be the background and environment to create a perfect setting for a battle scene. The aspect ratio should be 16:9 to fit standard screen dimensions.
