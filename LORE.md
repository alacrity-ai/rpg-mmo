### History of Aldera

#### The Ancient Times (Prehistoric Era)

In the distant past, Aldera was a land of untamed wilderness and primal forces. Little is known about this era, as written history was virtually non-existent. The world was dominated by vast forests, towering mountains, and sprawling deserts. The Southlands were a dense jungle, the Midlands a combination of grasslands and highlands, and the Coldlands a perpetually frozen wasteland. Nomadic tribes roamed the land, worshipping nature spirits and ancient deities.

#### The Age of Harmony (The Modern Era)

Over a thousand years ago, the world of Aldera entered a period of relative stability and prosperity, known as the Age of Harmony. Kingdoms and cities began to form, trade routes were established, and cultures flourished. This era saw the rise of prominent towns and cities, including Eldergrove, Tilford, Frostholm, and Eagle's Hollow.

##### Key Historical Figures:

- **King Eldrin of Eldergrove**: A wise and benevolent ruler who established the first herbal gardens and apothecary schools in Eldergrove. His leadership ensured peace and prosperity for his people.
- **Queen Tilara of Tilford**: A visionary leader who transformed Tilford into a bustling hub of commerce. Her strategic alliances with neighboring regions ensured the city's security and growth.
- **Lord Frost of Frostholm**: A resilient and pragmatic leader who oversaw the construction of warm shelters and the development of cold-weather gear, making Frostholm a vital waypoint for travelers heading into the Coldlands.
- **Explorer Calum**: A legendary adventurer who discovered Calum's Cave, bringing back rare minerals and treasures that fueled the prosperity of Harborview.

The Age of Harmony was marked by peace and cooperation. The Southlands, Midlands, and Coldlands thrived under the leadership of their respective rulers, and the region of Eagle's Hollow was known for its majestic giant eagles and the thriving city that supported them. However, this era of prosperity would eventually be overshadowed by ambition and corruption.

#### The Age of Shadows (The Dark Era)

##### The Rise of The Citadel

The Age of Shadows began a century ago, with the sudden and catastrophic rise of **The Citadel**. This massive fortress erupted from the northern mountains, tearing through the earth and reaching into the sky like a blight upon the land. The Citadel's appearance was not due to an ancient titan, but rather the actions of an ambitious and ultimately tragic historical figure: **Archmage Malakar**.

##### Archmage Malakar

Archmage Malakar was a brilliant and ambitious mage who lived during the latter part of the Age of Harmony. He was obsessed with unlocking the secrets of immortality and ultimate power, believing that he could use such knowledge to protect Aldera from any future threats. Malakar's research led him to ancient texts that spoke of a powerful artifact buried deep beneath the northern mountains, an artifact that could grant unimaginable power but at a great cost.

Ignoring the warnings and omens, Malakar embarked on an expedition to find this artifact, accompanied by his loyal followers. After years of searching, they finally unearthed the **Heart of Xal'gorath**, an artifact of immense power and corruption. Unbeknownst to Malakar, the artifact was a prison for the malevolent spirit of Xal'gorath, a once-powerful sorcerer who had been sealed away by the ancient titans.

##### The Calamity

In his hubris, Malakar attempted to harness the power of the Heart of Xal'gorath. The artifact's dark magic began to corrupt him and his followers, twisting their minds and bodies. As Malakar's control over the artifact weakened, the spirit of Xal'gorath began to break free. The ground shook, and the mountains split open as The Citadel rose from the earth, a dark and foreboding fortress that marked the beginning of the Age of Shadows.

The release of Xal'gorath's spirit unleashed a wave of corruption that spread rapidly across Aldera. The land itself began to wither, and the once-thriving regions fell into darkness and despair. The Southlands, Midlands, and Coldlands were all affected, but the Northern Wastes bore the brunt of the corruption, becoming a desolate and dangerous place.

##### Aftermath

In the century that followed, Aldera was plunged into chaos. The once-thriving trade routes were disrupted, and the towns and cities that had flourished during the Age of Harmony struggled to survive. The people of Aldera faced new horrors as the corruption twisted creatures and landscapes into nightmarish versions of their former selves.

##### Key Historical Events:

- **The Fall of Eagle's Hollow**: Once a thriving capital, Eagle's Hollow became a bleak and desolate city, its population decimated and its grandeur lost. The Eagle Rookery, once home to majestic giant eagles, became the Vulture Rookery, a place of monstrous birds and despair.
- **The Isolation of Frostholm**: As corruption spread, Frostholm became increasingly isolated. The city, once a beacon of hope in the frigid north, struggled to maintain its defenses against the encroaching darkness.
- **The Formation of Glacier's Edge Encampment**: Survivors from Coldforge Keep found refuge in an ice cave, forming the Glacier's Edge Encampment. Cut off from the rest of the world, they adapted to their harsh environment and became a symbol of resilience.
- **The Decline of Harborview**: Harborview, once a prosperous coastal town, faced economic collapse as trade routes were disrupted. The town's docks, once bustling with activity, became eerily quiet as the corruption spread from Calum's Cave.
